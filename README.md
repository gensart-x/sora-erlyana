# Overview

This application uses `whatsapp-web.js` as a primary library. Keep in mind if you want to use this app, I assume you did already know that :

```bash
🔴 WhatsApp terms & conditions do not allow any unofficial bots or automation on its services.
And this app should be used properly. I do not encourage any misuse that may hurt any person/group by the usage of this app. Please use it wisely, I create this for good reason.
```

So, I am not responsible for any banning happen to your WhatsApp account by using this app. **I strongly suggest** you to use this app with your new or backup WhatsApp number. I use my second number and still safe until now.

# Quickstart

The installation needs several steps, you might want to see the documentation for more information.

-   For quick installation, first thing you can clone the app, no matter what method you use, below is the simple example one using Git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gensart-x/sora-erlyana.git
```

-   After that, you need to install the dependencies needed for the app, by doing :

```bash
npm i
```

-   Next is renaming the `env` file to `.env`, and adjust the contents inside the `.env` with your own, see [configurations](https://gensart-x.github.io/sora-erlyana/#/configurations) or `env.ts` file for more information.

-   And, since the app was developed in Typescript, you can build it by using command provided on `package.json` :

```bash
npm run build
```

-   Or you can run directly the Typescript (for development), by using `npm run dev`. FYI, I use `tsx` for running `.ts` files.

-   If you have done the step above, you should see some QR code in the terminal, that's the same QR when you use WhatsApp Web for authenticating. Scan the QR using your WhatsApp app.

-   Wait for a message `System is online!` in your terminal, and voila ! You are successfully integrates your WhatsApp with the app ! ✨

-   Try to send `.help` to the WhatsApp you integrates in. It should return available commands as a response.
