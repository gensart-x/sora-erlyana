# Configurations  

For the configuration, I put all configuration/environment values inside `env` file, which you have been renamed to `.env` if you follow the [installation](installation) page.  

The value flow is like this :  
**.env** > **env.ts** > DONE - (`env.ts` imported the value from `.env`)

The `.env` provides the value of the configuration, and `env.ts` packages the values as an object, so you know each variable information.  

Adjust the values like the bot name, IMGBB Key, Ghola API, etc. with your own information.  

After you done the instruction above, next to the [quickstart](quickstart) page.
